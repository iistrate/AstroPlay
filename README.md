Practicum
=========

Building a programming helper for beginner programmers. Technologies used: C++, Python, and SDL2. 

The goal for this project was to build software that will help teach programming concepts to beginner programmers. 
The user’s goal is to write a set of instructions that will help an astronaut explore the Red Planet, and pick up samples of rock to be sent back to Earth.
Throughout the process, the user is helped in writing his instructions through a set of helpers that include: drag and drop commands, tool tip hints and auto complete.
The Software is built in C++, it makes use of Python for parsing the commands, and uses of SDL2 as a graphics library.

Commands as of 3/10/15:

UP

RIGHT

REPEAT <int> - loops command ex: REPEAT 20 RIGHT (moves Austronaut 20 steps to the right)

To be integrated:
